# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard has a number of employees that are approaching retirement age and Executive Leadership wants to understand the potential number of retirees and their roles or titles where they will retire from.  In addition Leadership wants to start a mentoring program for other senior team members to mentor them in preparation to backfill the potential retirees.  
The specific analysis requested is to generate two lists of employees:
- Potential retireees by title, those with birthdates from 1952 to 1955
- Candidates for mentorship, thoese employees born in 1965
## Results of the Analysis
### Deliverable 1 - Retiring Employees & Titles
The number of potetntial retirees is enormous.  Specifically the company is at risk of losing:
- 25,916 Senior Engineers
- 24,926 Senior Staff
The retirement of approximately 50,000 employees in senior roles could be crippling to the company.  In addition to the Senior Engineers retiring thare are:
-9,285 Engineers 
-1,090 Assistant Engineers
eligilble to retire.  The technical areas of the company will be impacted to the point where operating effeictively could be difficult.
### Deliverable 2 Mentorship Candidates
The initial review of employees to potentially act as mentors did not yield encouraging news.  The Engineering staff identified was:
- 169 Senior Engineers
- 501 Engineers
- 78 Assistant Engineers.
This number of mentors cannot likely support developing the skill base necessary to replace the experience leaving in retirement.
## Summary
The total number of employees retiring is 72,458.  Approximately half, 36,291, are coming from the Engineering team.  This will severly impact the ability of the company to introduce new products along with support for existing products.

There is a total of 1,549 total employees initially identified to fill mentor roles.  About half of them are from Engineering roles but they are not enough to support the volume of engineers retiring.  In general, the number of identified mentors is insufficient to help bridge the gap.
